# Vibe Landing Zone â€” Deployable Architecture

**One-click vibes.** This DA spins up a Cloud Object Storage bucket (Lite), hosts this app, and wires optional IBM Cloud Functions endpoints for:
- **Manifest âœ¨** (push code directly to the bucket)
- **Stage Update ðŸŒˆ** (create a Project-friendly config update marker)
- **Status & Analytics** (lightweight, optional)

### How to Use
1. Open the app URL (primary output) after deploy.
2. Edit in the in-browser IDE.
3. Click **Manifest âœ¨** to publish immediately, or **Stage Update ðŸŒˆ** to request a Project config update instead.
4. The green toast stays visible until dismissed if the action succeeds.

### Safety / Cost
- Lite plans only. No billable Function concurrency or storage class selected by default.
- Public-read only for `index.html`. No bucket-wide public policy is applied.

### Attribution
This work builds on ideas inspired by **Arn Hyndman** (static website deployable architectures).
