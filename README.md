# ðŸŒ€ Vibe Deployable Architecture â€” Flat Edition

**Powered by IBM Cloud**

This Deployable Architecture manifests a live web IDE where you can paste HTML, CSS, and JS into the browser and instantly deploy to a public IBM Cloud Object Storage Lite bucket.

> Built upon conceptual inspiration from [Arn Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/)'s work on deployable automation patterns, extended through AI collaboration and IBM Cloud best practices.
