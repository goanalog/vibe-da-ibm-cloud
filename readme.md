Deploy instantly to **IBM Cloud Object Storage** and host your vibe-coded single-page app.

---

### ðŸš€ How it Works
- Paste your **vibe-coded HTML** into the catalog input field.  
- If you leave it blank, your included **index.html** sample will deploy automatically.  
- Terraform provisions a free COS Lite instance and hosts your content publicly.

### ðŸ“¦ Outputs
| Name | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `vibe_url` | Public URL of your hosted app |
| `vibe_bucket_url` | Direct COS bucket URL |
