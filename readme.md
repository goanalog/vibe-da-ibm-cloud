# 🌐 Vibe Coder — IBM Cloud Deployable Architecture

A deployable architecture that hosts your vibe-coded single-page app on **IBM Cloud Object Storage**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Paste your HTML code into the **Vibe Code Input** field during deployment.
2. Or leave it blank — and the included `index.html` sample app will deploy automatically.

---

## ✅ Verify Your Deployment

Once your deployment completes, your hosted app will be instantly available at:

```
https://<bucket-name>.<region>.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/index.html
```

Or simply click the **`vibe_bucket_public_url`** output in your catalog workspace.

If you see an XML "AccessDenied" message, wait a few seconds and refresh — the public read policy may take a moment to propagate.
