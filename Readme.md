# 🌀 Deploy a whole mood — instantly and repeatedly  

Welcome to **vibe-driven development**, now blessed by **IBM Cloud Projects**.  

This **deployable architecture** doesn’t just spin up infrastructure — it spins up *possibility.*  

You get a live **sample app** that lets you paste your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript right into the browser and watch it run instantly on the real internet.  

Remix it, redeploy it, and watch your changes appear faster than you can say *“did that actually work?”*  

All powered by **IBM Cloud Object Storage (Lite)** — the free, enterprise-grade service that keeps your creations globally accessible and operationally blessed.

### ✨ What’s inside  

* 🧱 **Instant vibe deployment (yes, really)**  
  Paste your code into the sample app and watch it become a live web app, hosted in IBM Cloud Object Storage.  

  Edit it again and redeploy in seconds.  

  No repos, no terminals — just vibes.  

* 💻 **Interactive sample app**  
  It’s not a demo; it’s an experience.  

  A built-in front-end playground where you can experiment, remix, and manifest pure web energy.  

* ☁️ **Powered by IBM Cloud Object Storage (Lite, aka free)**  
  Free to start, free to play, and hosted on infrastructure so robust you’ll start trusting the cloud again.  

* 💾 **Infrastructure that feels like magic**  
  Everything is provisioned automatically through **IBM Cloud Projects** using Terraform.  

  You’ll look like you know DevOps, even if you just clicked a button.  

* 🧭 **For every type of professional (and person)**  
  Whether you’re a CTO *“evaluating innovation throughput,”* a developer seeking the perfect gradient, or a curious human on a lunch break — this app just works.  

* 🌍 **Public-ready hosting**  
  Once your code is deployed, it’s immediately shareable.  

  Send it to your team, your manager, or your mom. She’ll be impressed either way.
